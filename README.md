# Recipe Finder - Real-Time Guide Feature

## Overview
The Recipe Finder website now includes a real-time guide feature that helps users follow recipe instructions with timed steps. This feature provides a hands-free cooking experience with automatic step progression and visual feedback.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Recipe Creation
When creating a new recipe, users can now specify:
- **Ingredient Quantities**: Each ingredient includes a quantity field (e.g., "2 cups", "500g", "3 tablespoons")
- **Time-Based Instructions**: Each instruction step includes time input fields (minutes and seconds)
- **Minimum time per step is 10 seconds**
- **Time inputs are validated to ensure proper values**

### 2. Real-Time Guide Interface
The recipe details page now includes:
- **Start Guide Button**: Initiates the real-time guide
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Allows pausing and resuming the guide
- **Finish Button**: Stops the guide and resets to initial state
- **Timer Display**: Shows current step, countdown timer, and progress bar
- **Step Highlighting**: Current step is highlighted, completed steps are marked

### 3. Guide Functionality
- **Automatic Progression**: Steps automatically advance when the timer completes
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Current step is highlighted in orange
  - Completed steps are marked in green
  - Progress bar shows completion percentage
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications appear when steps complete
- **Pause/Resume**: Users can pause at any time and resume where they left off

## How to Use

   - Set the time duration (minutes and seconds)
5. Submit the recipe

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
Recipes now store ingredients and instructions in the following format:
```json
{
  "ingredients": ["water", "pasta", "salt"],
  "quantities": ["2 cups", "500g", "1 tsp"],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Boil water in a large pot",
      "time": 120
    },
    {
      "text": "Add pasta and cook for 8 minutes",
      "time": 480
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Old recipes without time data will use a default 60-second timer per step
- Old recipes without quantity data will display ingredients without quantities
- The system automatically detects and handles both old and new recipe formats

### CSS Classes
- `.active`: Current step highlighting
- `.completed`: Completed step styling
- `.step-notification`: Toast notification styling
- `.guide-controls`: Guide button container
- `.timer-display`: Timer and progress display

## Browser Compatibility
This feature works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 modules
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS transitions and animations

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Sound notifications for step completion
